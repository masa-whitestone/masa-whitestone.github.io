# Personal Website Rewrite Instructions

## 1. Purpose of the Website

This website is a **personal research & engineering portfolio**, not a blog-centric site and not a resume clone.

Primary goals:
- Clearly communicate my identity as a **Quantum Computing × AI engineer/researcher**
- Emphasize **implementation-driven work** and real systems
- Serve as a professional entry point for future **collaboration, research, and entrepreneurship**

Target audience:
- Researchers in quantum computing / AI
- Engineers in deep-tech companies
- Startup founders, CTOs, and R&D engineers

Tone:
- Minimal
- Technical
- Confident
- Forward-looking
- Avoid “student portfolio” vibes


## 2. Core Identity (must be respected everywhere)

Name:
- Masaki Shiraishi

Role:
- Quantum Algorithm & AI Engineer

One-line positioning:
- Working at the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, with a focus on implementation and real-world impact.

Background facts (do not invent new ones):
- Applied Physics @ Waseda University
- Implementation experience with Shor’s algorithm for ECDLP
- Quantum × AI projects with collaborators connected to AIST and NVIDIA
- Former Quantum Algorithms Research Intern at blocq
- Interested in deep-tech innovation and future entrepreneurship


## 3. Overall Site Structure (Single-page, project-driven)

Required sections in this order:

1. Hero
2. About
3. Featured Projects
4. Experience
5. Skills / Focus Areas
6. Blog
7. Contact & Links


## 4. Section-Level Requirements

### 4.1 Hero

Must immediately answer:
- Who am I?
- What domain do I work in?

Hero must include:
- Name
- Role (Quantum Algorithm & AI Engineer)
- A short 1–2 line description

Avoid:
- Overly flashy animation
- Buzzword overload
- Academic formality


### 4.2 About

Purpose:
- Explain mindset, not full biography

Guidelines:
- 8–10 lines max
- Emphasize implementation over theory
- Frame research and engineering as complementary
- Mention entrepreneurship interest briefly



### 4.3 Featured Projects (Most Important)

Each project should follow this structure:

- Project Title
- One-sentence problem statement
- My role (implementation, experimentation, system design, etc.)
- Tech keywords (quantum algorithms, AI, HPC, etc.)
- Context (Academic / Industry / Research collaboration)

Notes:
- 3–4 projects max
- Ongoing projects are acceptable
- “Work in Progress” is allowed
- Clear, concrete language preferred over abstract claims


### 4.4 Experience

Keep it concise.

Include:
- Osaka University – Quantum Software Research Hub (Present)
- blocq – Quantum Algorithms Research Intern (Past)
- Waseda University – Applied Physics

Do NOT:
- Add long descriptions
- Duplicate LinkedIn-level details


### 4.5 Skills / Focus Areas

Use short lists or tags.

Include:
- Quantum Computing / Quantum Algorithms
- Quantum × AI / Hybrid methods
- AI Agents
- Implementation & prototyping
- Programming (Python, quantum SDKs if needed)

Do not list everything—selection matters.


### 4.6 Blog

Purpose:
- Preserve existing blog content
- Integrate cleanly into the new site structure

Rules:
- Blog content should be migrated **as-is**
- No rewriting or summarization
- No restructuring of article content
- Only adjust layout and navigation

Notes:
- Only one existing blog post
- Blog should not dominate the site
- Blog exists as secondary content


### 4.7 Contact & Links

Must include:
- Email
- LinkedIn
- GitHub
- Personal website URL

Optional:
- X (Twitter)

Add a soft call-to-action:
- “Feel free to reach out for collaboration or discussion.”


## 5. Technical Preferences

Preferred stack:
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS or minimal CSS
- MDX for content (projects and blog)

Content separation:
- Projects and blog posts must be written in Markdown or MDX
- Code and content must be clearly separated

Design philosophy:
- Minimal UI
- High readability
- Desktop-first, but responsive


## 6. Explicit Constraints

The AI must NOT:
- Add achievements or affiliations not explicitly stated
- Overemphasize student status
- Use exaggerated or marketing-heavy language
- Reorder major sections without reason

The AI SHOULD:
- Optimize for clarity and credibility
- Prefer simple structure over clever tricks
- Treat this site as a long-term professional asset

## Blog Migration Instructions

- There is only one existing blog post.
- The content of the blog post must be preserved verbatim.
- Do not rewrite, summarize, or edit the text.
- Structural issues in the old site (readability, navigation) should be fixed.
- Treat the blog as secondary content, not the main focus of the site.
- Convert the existing content into a clean Markdown or MDX format.
