It had been 10 years since my last visit to New York. I was just a fourth grader back then, and while some of my memories are a bit hazy, I can still vividly recall the dazzling lights of Broadway, the imposing buildings of Wall Street, and the vast greenery of Central Park. This time, my reunion with the city far exceeded my memories.

The city pulsed with an overwhelming energy, so powerful it felt like being inside a massive living organism.

In this blog post, I'd like to share my journey through New York, framed as a reunion with the city of my childhood memories.

## The Frenzy of Times Square and the View from the Empire State Building

I first experienced New York's energy firsthand in Times Square. Day and night, the constant honking of horns, the brilliant, giant screens, and the crowds of people from all over the world created an atmosphere that felt like a live concert. While Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing is also crowded, this was a completely different, raw kind of power. It's a place where you truly feel that this city is one of the centers of the world.

Wanting to see the city's energy from above, I headed to the Empire State Building, a symbol of Manhattan. The view from the observation deck was absolutely breathtaking. The city was a sprawling concrete jungle. Even at night, the countless buildings radiated light, making it feel as bright as day. In that sea of light, I spotted the shining display of the NASDAQ. The sight of people bustling below looked so cool to me. It sparked a grand dream: to one day list my own company here. New York gave me that aspiration.

## The Dreams of Broadway and the Weight of Wall Street

Another light that colors the New York night is Broadway. This was my first time seeing a show here, and I watched The Great Gatsby. The stage set, the actors' performances, and the world of the story all captivated me. The raw power of a live Broadway production was overwhelming, and simply being there made me feel like I was in a dream.

The next day, the city's vibe changed completely. I headed to Wall Street, the financial heart of the city. A tense atmosphere hung in the air, a stark contrast to the frenzy of Times Square. The massive New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building, with its imposing presence, told a story of the city's history and authority. People moved with a focused purpose, with no hesitation in their steps. This was another side of the energy that drives New York.

## The Refined Tastes of a Refined City

In contrast to the tension of Wall Street, New York also has a quiet, sophisticated side. I was captivated by Tribeca, with its stylish brick buildings. The frantic energy of Times Square was a distant memory here; time seemed to flow more leisurely. The people walking the streets appeared calm, and just being in the neighborhood made me feel a bit more refined myself.

In Tribeca, I visited Locanda Verde, a restaurant co-owned by actor Robert De Niro. Everything I ate there was absolutely delicious. Another dining experience that left a particularly strong impression was at Le Bernardin, a Michelin three-star restaurant. The main dish had a sashimi-like taste, and even as a Japanese person, I was shocked by its delicate flavor and perfect preparation. It proved to me that New York's vitality is deeply rooted not only in its economy and culture but also in its food scene.

## The Stimulation of Art and Knowledge

New York is like a giant museum in itself. At MoMA (Museum of Modern Art), I saw a Picasso painting in person for the first time. It was completely different from what I had seen in photos; I could feel the brushstrokes and the thickness of the paint, an emotion words can't describe. I was also pleasantly surprised to find an industrial design exhibit that I had studied in a class.

At the American Museum of Natural History, I was thrilled to be in the setting of Night at the Museum. I was particularly moved by the Big Bang exhibit, which explored the vast theme of the beginning of the universe. The fossil collection might be more impressive in a museum in England, but the unique charm of this city's museums is something you can't find anywhere else.

## In Conclusion: What New York Gave Me

This trip to New York was more than just a vacation.

This city, which I was reunited with after 10 years, gave me immense inspiration and dreams, blending frenzy with tranquility, dreams with reality, and past with present. I was overwhelmed by the power of Times Square, dreamed big on Wall Street, was touched by the sophistication of Tribeca, and was stimulated by art and knowledge.
